# bridge-samples-swift

This repo contains various sample projects which show using .NET and 
Swift with SourceGear Bridge.

(Note that SourceGear Bridge is not yet considered production-ready.)

These samples should work on Linux or Mac, as long as you have:

    - Swift 5.5
    - .NET 6.0

If you're on a Mac, note that these projects do include a Package.swift
file and are intended to be compatible with use of Xcode 13.
